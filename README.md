# Understanding the Relationship Between Neutrophil Function and Demographic Variables

Script author: Elise Hickman, PhD (ehickman@email.unc.edu)

This repository contains script associated with the unpublished manuscript titled "Understanding the Relationship Between Neutrophil Function and Demographic Variables" (Hickman E, Rebuli ME, Robinette C, Jaspers I, 2023).

This script was developed to 1) determine whether there are significant differences in phagocytic function and oxidative burst bioenergetic parameters between neutrophils isolated from male and female adult subjects; and 2) determine whether phagocytic function and oxidative burst bioenergetic parameters are correlated in human neutrophils.
